Please "file a ticket":https://www.macruby.org/trac/newticket on the "MacRuby Trac":https://www.macruby.org/trac/report component, if you want to contribute an enhancement request or a bug report. Patches with test cases are welcome.
You can also send your feedback to the MacRuby-devel mailing-list.
If you want to help us, do not hesitate to introduce yourself in the mailing-list; we will give you an overview of things that need to be done. If you want to commit your code directly in the repository, please note that you will have to sign a committer agreement first; we will provide this to you.
