<% @page[:excerpt] = capture_erb do %>
We are glad to announce the release of MacRuby 0.8, after two months and a half of development since the previous version.
<% end %>
<%= RedCloth.new(@page.excerpt).to_html %>

This release focuses on stability and compatibility. Users of MacRuby are encouraged to upgrade.

You can download it from "here":http://www.macruby.org/files/MacRuby%200.8.zip. Please note that this package only runs on Snow Leopard (10.6) or later. Older Mac OS X versions are no longer supported.

Please give it a try and "let us know":/contact-us.html of any problems you find!

The "complete release notes":http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macruby-devel/2010-December/006594.html are available.

h3. Converging for 1.0

The MacRuby team is now converging all its efforts into the delivery of MacRuby's first stable release, 1.0.

We intend to deliver starting from now releases much more frequently than before. We hope that users will then test MacRuby more frequently, and as such, report more bugs.

However, we do not expect further releases to introduce significant features, as we are now focusing on stability and compatibility issues.

The tickets in our tracker have recently been triaged into two piles: those "needed for 1.0":http://www.macruby.org/trac/report/17 and those which will be addressed in "later releases":http://www.macruby.org/trac/report/18. 

We will organize bug smashes in order to collectively reduce the 1.0 tickets. The very first one was organized a couple weeks ago and was a success, as we were able to sort and reduce most of our tickets. We will likely start fixing bugs for real in the second one, which will be announced on the "mailing-list":http://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/macruby-devel soon. Stay tuned!
